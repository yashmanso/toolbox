# Overview
The Impact Compass is an analytical tool created by the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford University, designed to help individuals and organizations evaluate and maximize their social impact. It focuses on six key dimensions: outcomes, reach, depth, sustainability, leverage, and context. This tool is particularly useful for decision-making processes where the goal is to determine the most effective allocation of resources, be it time, money, or effort, towards activities that generate positive social outcomes. The Impact Compass serves as a guide for those looking to invest in, work for, or donate to organizations that align with their impact goals, and it is especially relevant for sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation, where the balance of social, environmental, and economic factors is crucial.
