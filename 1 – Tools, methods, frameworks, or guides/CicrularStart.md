# Overview
CircularStart is an initiative designed to empower startups with the knowledge and tools necessary to embed circular economy principles into their business models from inception. Supported by the EU's Erasmus+ program and involving partners from six European countries, CircularStart offers an online course with modules covering ideation, integration, validation, and implementation. The course content spans circular business models, life cycle assessment, eco-design, and sustainable finance. Additionally, the project provides a suite of tools and resources, including a circularity assessment tool, a sustainability canvas, and a circularity playbook. The Guidance Tool, central to the project, is a 10-step framework that aligns with Circular Economy Readiness Levels (CERLs), paralleling Technology and Market Readiness Levels (TRLs, MRLs) to guide startups through the process of integrating circularity into their business practices.
