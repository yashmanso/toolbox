# Overview
The [Sustainability Impact Canvas (SIC)](https://www.threebility.com/sustainability-impact-canvas) is a strategic tool designed to help designers and businesses evaluate and optimize the sustainability impacts of their products and business models. It encourages a comprehensive assessment of both positive and negative effects across three levels: technology, application, and systems. The SIC promotes "honest accounting" by addressing potential confirmation bias and serves as a precursor for realistic impact assessments. It is beneficial for identifying waste capture, minimizing lifecycle impacts, optimizing substitution potential, reducing obsolescence, incentivizing smart decision-making, and mitigating systemic risks. The tool is versatile, serving as an input for the Sustainable Business Model Canvas, and is accompanied by guidelines and examples to facilitate its use.
